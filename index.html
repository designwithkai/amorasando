		<p class = "letter">I know that I usually handwrite my letters to you whenever I get the chance to send something directly to you, however I thought that I would try something new &ndash; something that lasts for as long as the web does...forever, like my love for you.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class = "letter">Today is such a very special day because it marks one of the greatest days in history, the day you were welcomed onto the earth. I know that I couldn't have been there, but boy if I could have, I certainly would have.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class = "letter">I'm so honoured to be celebrating the completion of your 32nd year of life, and even more honoured to be celebrating it as your life partner.

		<h3>A poem for my love</h3>
		<p>I wake in the morning,<br/>
		When the east coast light comes through my blinds,<br/>
		I'm sure to keep the curtains shut</br>
		Because at 6 am, waking from a slumber is my <i>true</i> sunshine.</p>
		
		<p>For another magnificent year,<br/>
		I'm so happy that I could shed a tear,<br/>
		I'll smile big on the day you're ninety,<br/>
		As we hold hands in our rocking chair.</p>
		
		<p>This is really only the beginning,<br/>
		See our wedding is on the way,<br/>
		I'll be screaming when I say &quot;I do&quot;,<br/>
		But for now I'm shouting <b>HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYYYYYYY<b></p>
